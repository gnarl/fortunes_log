This is a fortunes logging application that uses the micro-framework Camping created by _why.  

The application was created back in 2006 just to see how far I could take it and it is still in production today.  I won't tell you where it is running in order to protect the innocent and guilty alike.

TODO:
*  Refactor methods that are too long.  
*  Import the CSS from another file.
*  Add a config file.
