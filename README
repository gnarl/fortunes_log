This is a fortunes logging application that uses the micro-framework Camping created by _why.  

The application was created back in 2006 just to see how far I could take it and it is still in 
production today.  I won't tell you where it is running in order to protect the innocent and 
guilty alike.

If reviewed the code a bit before committing it to github and a few things I'd do to fix it up:
*  Some of the longer and/or more confusing methods need to be broken down into smaller methods.  
*  The passwords need to be hashed and ssl support added.  
*  The CSS should be imported from another file.
*  Configurable settings need to be read from a config file.

I am not going to say what I plan to do with this in the future until I actually start doing something.
